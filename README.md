# AirBnB_clone
==============

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
This version of the AirBnB clone looks to start the very fundamental process of developing a website having a variety of functionalities. The project will be completed using the python language and Object Oriented Programming (OOB) will be fully implemented. Consequently, a command line interface should also be developed to test out the functionalities of the website.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMAND INTEPRETER
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
